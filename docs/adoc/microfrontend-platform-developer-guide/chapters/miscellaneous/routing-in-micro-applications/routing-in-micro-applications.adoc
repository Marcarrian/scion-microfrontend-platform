== Routing in Micro Applications

The platform recommends using hash-based routing over HTML 5 push-state routing in micro applications.

When routing between microfrontends, the router outlet sets the iframe location to the URL of the routed microfrontend. When navigating between microfrontends of the same micro application, push-state routing would cause the micro-application to reload on every routing. As hash-based routing uses the fragment part (`#`) of the URL to simulate different routes, routing does not cause the user agent to load the application anew, resulting in better user experience.

Refer to the documentation of the UI framework of the micro application on how to activate hash-based routing.
