== Focus Monitor
The focus monitor allows observing if the current microfrontend has received focus or contains embedded web content that has received focus. It behaves like the `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class but operates across iframe boundaries. For example, it can be useful when implementing overlays that close upon focus loss.

The Observable emits when the current microfrontend or any of its child microfrontends has gained or lost focus. The Observable does not emit while the focus remains within this microfrontend or any of its child microfrontends. Upon subscription, the Observable emits the current focus-within state, and then continuously emits when it changes. It never completes.
